# 🧙‍♂️ Hey! I'm Alaedeen.

### *Software Engineer @ InstaDeep | GDG Sousse Organizer*

Based in **Tunisia 🇹🇳**, I spend most of my time over-engineering simple solutions because "it scales better" and explaining to my computer why my architecture is superior.

### 🧐 About Me

- 🔭 **Currently working on:** Enterprise solutions using **DDD**, **CQRS**, and **Event Sourcing**.
- 🧠 **My Engineering Philosophy:** If it's not **TDD**, is it even code?
- 🛡️ **Patterns I Abuse:** **ROP** (Railway Oriented Programming) because I hate exceptions, and **Clean Architecture** because I hate spaghetti.
- 👯 **Looking to collaborate on:** .NET Core projects that actually need complex domain modeling.

> *I cheat on C# with **Golang** on the weekends. Simple, fast, and no inheritance hell.*

### ⚡ Fun Facts

- 🤖 **My Relationship with AI:** I treat Copilot like a junior intern—I let it suggest code, have a good laugh at it, and then rewrite it properly using **DDD**.
- 🐧 **Sudo** is my magic word.
- 🐛 I don't just fix bugs; I create an abstraction layer to ensure that specific bug can never happen again.
- 🌤️ I built a [Weather App](https://github.com/Alaedeen/nodejs-weather-app) once, but I still look out the window to check if it's raining.
